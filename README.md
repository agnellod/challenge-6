# challenge-6
- First I added the starter files
- Then I added the html to style and add classes
- After that I started to add java script to make the page functional
- I added dayjs to keep track of current day 
- Then I targeted specific parts of the api array to display the fields I wanted
- Then I saved the data for past searches in local storage
- I created a for loop for making a button for each past city searched and linked that to the api so can review other cities youve searched without having to search again
