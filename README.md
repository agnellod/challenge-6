# challenge-6
- First I added the starter files
- Then I added the html to style and add classes
- After that I started to add java script to make the page functional
- I added dayjs to keep track of current day 
- Then I targeted specific parts of the api array to display the fields I wanted
- Then it was due and I ran out of time I will come back and add local storage and buttons for past searches
